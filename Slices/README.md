### Slices 
      A slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.

- A slice is a convenient, flexible and powerful wrapper on top of an array.
       - Slices do not own any data on their own. They are just references to existing arrays.
- A slice with elements of type T is represented by []T
